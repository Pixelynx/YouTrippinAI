# YouTrippinAI

## Project Overview

This Travel Recommendation App is a React-based application that provides personalized travel suggestions based on user input. It utilizes a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system to offer context-aware and accurate recommendations.

## Features (MVP)

- User input form for personal information, travel preferences, and previous trips
- AI-powered recommendation system
- Display of personalized travel recommendations

## Technologies Used

- React
- Redux (for state management)
- Django (backend)
- PostgreSQL with pgvector (database)

## API Endpoints

## Project Implementation Steps

### 1. Project Setup
- Initialize a new React application using Create React App or Next.js.
- Set up the project structure, including components, pages, and utility folders.
- Set up a version control system and create an initial commit.

### 2. Database Setup
- Choose and set up a database system.
- Design the database schema to store user profiles and preferences.
- Set up environment variables for database credentials.

### 3. Backend API Development
- Create a Node.js/Express server for handling API requests.
- Implement RESTful endpoints for user data operations.

### 4. Dataset Preparation
- Download and explore the Kaggle dataset containing user profile data.
- Clean and pre-process the data as needed (e.g., handling missing values, encoding categorical variables).
- Identify key columns that will be used for user profiling and similarity matching.
- Import the processed dataset into database.

### 5. User Interface Development
- Create React components for user input forms, profile display, and recommendation results.
- Implement responsive design using CSS frameworks.
- Develop navigation and routing for different sections of the app.

### 6. User Input Collection
- Design and implement a user input form component.
- Ensure the input fields align with the columns in the Kaggle dataset for consistency.
- Implement client-side data validation to ensure user inputs are in the correct format and range.
- Create API calls to send user input to the backend for processing.

### 7. RAG Implementation
- Set up a vector database to store profile embeddings.
- Choose an appropriate embedding model.
- Convert existing user profiles from the Kaggle dataset into embeddings and store them in the vector database.
- Implement functions to embed new user inputs in the same vector space.

### 8. Similarity Matching
- Develop a similarity search function using the vector database.
- Implement a method to retrieve the top-k most similar profiles for a given user input.
- Test and optimize the similarity matching process for accuracy and efficiency.

### 9. LLM Integration for Recommendations
- Set up an LLM for generating recommendations.
- Design prompts that effectively utilize similar user profiles to generate travel recommendations.
- Implement error handling and fallback mechanisms for LLM interactions.
- Create an API endpoint to handle LLM requests and responses.

### 10. Frontend-Backend Integration
- Connect the React frontend to the backend API.
- Implement state management for handling application data.
- Create hooks for API calls and data fetching.
