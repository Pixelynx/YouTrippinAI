# YouTrippinAI

## Project Overview

This Travel Recommendation App is a React-based application that provides personalized travel suggestions based on user input. It utilizes a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system to offer context-aware and accurate recommendations.

## Features (MVP)

- User input form for personal information, travel preferences, and previous trips
- AI-powered recommendation system
- Display of personalized travel recommendations

## Technologies Used

- React
- Redux (for state management)
- Django (backend)
- PostgreSQL with pgvector (database)

## API Endpoints

## Project Implementation Steps

### 1. Dataset Preparation
- Download and explore the Kaggle dataset containing user profile data.
- Clean and pre-process the data as needed (e.g., handling missing values, encoding categorical variables).
- Identify key columns that will be used for user profiling and similarity matching.

### 2. User Input Collection
- Design a user interface or input mechanism to collect new user data.
- Ensure the input fields align with the columns in the Kaggle dataset for consistency.
- Implement data validation to ensure user inputs are in the correct format and range.

### 3. RAG Implementation
- Set up a vector database to store profile embeddings.
- Choose an appropriate embedding model.
- Convert existing user profiles from the Kaggle dataset into embeddings and store them in the vector database.
- Implement functions to embed new user inputs in the same vector space.

### 4. Similarity Matching
- Develop a similarity search function using the vector database.
- Implement a method to retrieve the top-k most similar profiles for a given user input.
- Test and optimize the similarity matching process for accuracy and efficiency.

### 5. LLM Integration for Recommendations
- Set up an LLM for generating recommendations.
- Design prompts that effectively utilize similar user profiles to generate travel recommendations.
- Implement error handling and fallback mechanisms for LLM interactions.

### 6. System Integration and Testing
- Combine all components into a cohesive system.
- Develop a pipeline that takes user input, finds similar profiles, and generates recommendations.
- Conduct thorough testing with various user inputs to ensure system reliability and quality of recommendations.
